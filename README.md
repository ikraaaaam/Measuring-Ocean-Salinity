# Measuring-Ocean-Salinity
The problem is about to find the salinity of ocean water. First of all, I loaded the data in jupyter notebook and put a detailed look inti the data. I dropped the feature which seemed unnecessary for the determination of the result. I calculated the missing percentage of each feature and dropped the features which have more than 30% missing values. Then I label encoded the categorical features. Later, I calculated the correlation of the features on the basis of the Label data and removed the features that are highly correlated to each other. Then, I dropped all the rows with Nan values out there. Then I did the feature scaling and train test split and Lastly I trained the regression models.
